            ## New Features
            - Fixed issue where `$` command in normal mode did not reach the end of the line, causing incorrect cursor placement.

            ## Previous Changes
            - Introduced `enable_notifications` option to control notifications for actions like enabling/disabling typewriter mode, and aligning code blocks.
            - Added new `:TWTop` and `:TWBottom` commands to align the current code block with the top or bottom of the screen, respectively.
            - Introduced `keep_cursor_position` option to maintain cursor's relative position within the text when using `:TWCenter`, `:TWTop`, and `:TWBottom`.
            - Added `:TWCenter` command to center the view around the current code block or function using Tree-sitter.
            - Introduced Tree-sitter as a dependency for intelligent code block detection.
            - Updated installation instructions to include Tree-sitter setup.
            - Moved `center_block_config.lua` to the `utils` folder for better organization.
            - Enhanced README with information about the `:TWCenter` command and Tree-sitter dependency.

            ## Core Features
            - Keeps the cursor centered on the screen while typing or navigating.
            - Simple commands to enable, disable, and toggle the typewriter mode.
            - Integrates with ZenMode and True Zen for a seamless distraction-free environment.
